Traffic Light System with Blynk Integration
Overview
This project simulates a traffic light system with Blynk integration for remote monitoring. Using an Arduino Yun, it controls three LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) and allows real-time status updates through the Blynk app.

Setup Instructions
Hardware: Connect the LEDs to the Arduino Yun using the Grove Shield.
Blynk Setup:
Download the Blynk app and create a new project for Arduino Yun.
Copy the provided auth token.
Code Upload:
Upload the code to the Arduino Yun and update the Wi-Fi credentials in the code.
Run the Project: Open the Blynk app and view the traffic light status in real-time.
Dependencies
Blynk library for Arduino
Code Walkthrough
The Blynk library updates the app with the traffic light status using virtual pin V0 (Green, Yellow, Red).

Future Enhancements
Machine Learning integration to optimize light timings based on traffic conditions.
